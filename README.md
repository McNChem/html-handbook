# The HTML Handbook (draft)

This repo contains a draft of the HTML Handbook, a free ebook I'm about to publish.

Feedback I'm looking for:

- Did I miss something important?
- Is something explained in a way that's too complicated?
- Did I add things irrelevant?
- Are there any typos?

I welcome PRs for typos, or even just if you can comment inline in GitHub, I can find them.

Thanks a lot!
